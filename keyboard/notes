setxkbmap

In /etc/X11 is a file named Xmodmap which contains examples for changing keys. Copy this file as .Xmodmap into your $HOME directory or create an empty file with that name.
Add following line into that file:
keysym Control_R = Control_R
After next login Shift + Ctrl_R is not the compose key anymore. More info you can get with man xmodmap.
It is a per user solution but it is enough for me. Could not find how to change it for whole system.

Anyway, thanks for trying to help me.
