I’ve had a Raspberry Pi sitting on my desk at home for months telling me whether I had new Gmail. At $35, the Pi is cheap, but I sure wasn’t getting my money’s worth using it as a glorified dock notification. Then I saw this post from Pivotal Labs about using a Pi as a kiosk. I immediately thought of using a Pi to display Graphite graphs at work, and while it took an ashamedly long time to get moving on the project, the configuration only took an hour.
The full setup - with the Pi exposed.

Configuring the Pi to be a kiosk was pretty easy. The idea is to have the Pi boot to a full-screen browser that loads a predetermined page. Additionally, I installed VNC so that I could view the desktop remotely if necessary.

I followed the following steps starting from a fresh Raspbian image:

Use raspi-config to:

    enable ssh
        change the locale and timezone
	    boot to desktop
	        expand_rootfs

		Update and install some software:

		$ sudo apt-get update
		$ sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer unclutter x11vnc x11-xserver-utils

		Disable sleep so the screen stays on:

		$ sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf

# add the following lines to the [SeatDefaults] section

# don't sleep the screen
		xserver-command=X -s 0 dpms

		Configure LXDE to start the Midori browser on login:

		$ sudo vi /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart

# comment everything and add the following lines

		@xset s off
		@xset -dpms
		@xset s noblank
		@midori -e Fullscreen -a http://example.com

		Configure VNC to start on boot

		$ sudo curl -o /etc/init.d/x11vnc https://raw.github.com/starlightmedia/bin/master/x11vnc
		$ sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/x11vnc
		$ sudo update-rc.d x11vnc defaults

		That should be all you need to do to get the Pi configured. I use RealVNC to connect to the Pi.

		If I’ve left something out, please leave a comment and let me know.
